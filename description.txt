Vampire Knives Extended adds many new knives and vampire-based accessories into the game, along with a few random (poorly sprited) pets. You'll want a recipe browser.

Also, there is optional compatibility (included in the mod) with calamity mod that adds 6 new knives to the game that *should* scale well. 

Recent Changes:

Ported to most recent version
Fixed some textures
Changed some damage scaling
Big nerf to lifesteal, but will likely be nerfed further as testing continues
Complete change to vampire necklace (Based on bosses killed)
Addition of a skin shop for the necklace (Talk to the Vampire NPC)
Addition of new tier of defense knives
Addition of new tier of support knives (Tier 3 scales as you defeat bosses)


Past Changes: 

New town NPC - Arrives after either BoC or EoW is defeated.

A new crafting table that allows you to craft anything and everything from the mod, and will even decrease the material costs of every item.
A TON of new knives, more than I could remember.
A new knife damage class.
A new armor set, that scales with each boss you defeat.

MANY Many changes to balance.
New way to craft the casts, knives, throwing knives, etc. w/out spawning another at random. (For more info on recipes that require casts, hammers, chisels, etc. join the discord, though, a wiki is in the works!)

Vampire Knives Extended adds many new knives and vampire-based accessories into the game, along with a few random (poorly sprited) pets. You'll want a recipe browser.

Also, there is optional compatibility (included in the mod) with calamity mod that adds 6 new knives to the game that *should* scale well. 

Hotfix 3.4.1: Removed left over testing code

Update 3.4, The Armor and QoL update:
----------------------------------------------------
-A few new knives have been added that fill the gaps that were previously present, please feel free to give me feedback on how they can be balanced.
-**Two new armor sets** allowing for specialization between support, damage, and tanking
-You can now **upgrade your knives at your knife workbench** by using the little hammer button
-Added ways to **make Silt,Sand,Marble, and Granite.(All from dirt, stone, and obsidian)** Working on a more conventional and fun way of doing this, but that's later down the road. Hope this reduces the grind a bit for whetstones while still not making them easier to craft.
-Temporarily,** obsidian is now renewable to aid with crafting granite**, this can be obtained by throwing bottled water into lava.
-Non-vampire-knives items will no longer appear with the vampire upgrade stats tool-tips upon being crafted
I'm sure there are other changes, but these are the major big ones.

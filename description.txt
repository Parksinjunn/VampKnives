Vampire Knives Extended adds around 20 new vampire knife based weapons into the game and a few random pets. You'll want a recipe browser, I finished work on this mod a year ago and just got back to it so there are definitely some bugs. I recently got more time to work on this, so updates will be coming, but realize this mod is mainly just for my friends and I to play with. If anyone wants to update this regularly and take it over feel free, just message me on the forum~!

Also, there is optional compatibility (included in the mod) with calamity mod that adds 5 new knives to the game that *should* scale well. 

Recent Changes:
**IMBUEMENT SYSTEM IS OUT-THE-DOOR, REFUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY WHO PREVIOUSLY MADE THESE KNIVES**
-Added Hoods (Hotkey "P" by default, you can find out more info on the discord)
-Added Mandable Knives (not finished to completion)
-Finished Light and Dark Knives
-Added option to convert vampire knives(melee) to magic
-Added plant fiber drop to plantera
-Added stone knife sculpt that can be used to create the knife cast
-Many other small fixes and additions I can't remember at the moment.

I'll be on vacation for the next week or so, so don't expect any updates for a bit (Sorry T.T)

Vampire Knives Extended adds many new knives and vampire-based accessories into the game, along with a few random (poorly sprited) pets. You'll want a recipe browser. I will be fixing bugs over the course of the next few days, feel free to join the Discord to give bug reports and what-not ^_^ If anyone wants to update this regularly and take it over feel free, just message me in the discord server~!

Also, there is optional compatibility (included in the mod) with calamity mod that adds 5 new knives to the game that *should* scale well. 

Recent Changes:
New town NPC - Arrives after either BoC or EoW is defeated.
New healing system - The more damage you do, the more Blood Essence you accrue.
A new crafting table that allows you to craft anything and everything from the mod, and will even decrease the material costs of every item.
A TON of new knives, more than I could remember.
A new knife damage class.
A few new accessories to make the new damage class viable.
MANY Many changes to balance.
New way to craft the casts, knives, throwing knives, etc. w/out spawning another at random. (For more info on recipes that require casts, hammers, chisels, etc. join the discord, though, a wiki is in the works!)
Probably a whole lot more I'm forgetting :P
